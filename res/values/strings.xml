    <string name="about_text">
Where is Io lets you know where the 4 galliean satellites of Jupiter are
at any given time.  Even through only 8x binoculars you can make out these
4 moons on nights when Jupiter is up.

The portrait view shows a 4 day window of time, with the orange line 
representing the current state.  In landscape view, you get a close up on
the first portion of the graph (total time will vary based on the aspect
ratio of your device).  Jupiter's size is slightly exagerated (2x) for aesthetics.

This is a work in progress, expect to see additional functions rolled out
over time.

Jupiter is the 5th planet from the Sun, and the largest in our solar system.
The 4 largest moons of Jupiter were discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610, 
and are hence named the Galilean Satelites.\n
\n\
The Galilean satelites can be seen with a typical set of 8 power field binoculars.
They will show up in a distinct line of points on either side of the clearly round
Jupiter.

Io is the inner most moon of Jupiter.  It is also the most geologically
active object in the entire Solar system due to the gravitational flexing
from Jupiter and the other Galilean Satelites.  Io has volcanos that produce
plumes of sulfur up to 500 km (310 mi) above the surface.  This is higher
than the orbit of the International Space Station.\n

Europa is the second closest moon of Jupiter.  It's claim to fame is being
one of the smoothest objects in the solar system, with very few craters.  The
surface of Europa is made of solid water ice, and some models suggest a deep
liquid water ocean beneath the surface.  Such an ocean may be the most likely
place for non terrestrial life in the Solar System.

Ganymede is the third Galliean satelite, and the 7th moon of Jupiter.  It is
the largest satelite of any planet in our Solar System.  Ganymede is known to
have both a salt water ocean, and is the only moon in the Solar System to have
generate it's own magnetic field.\n

\n\
Callisto is the outer most of the Galliean satelites.  While smaller than Ganymede
it is still nearly the size of the planet Mercury.  Like our moon, Callisto is tidally
locked to it's planet, so the same side always faces Jupiter.  Because of Callisto's 
distance from Jupiter it has relatively low radiation levels compared to the inner moons,
and thus would be a reasonable candidate for a manned base to explore the Jupiter
system.\n
